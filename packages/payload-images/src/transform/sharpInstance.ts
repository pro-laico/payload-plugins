/**
 * Lazy Sharp loader with one-time global tuning. `sharp` is an optional peer and kept
 * out of client bundles, so it's imported on first use. On first load we cap the
 * per-image libvips thread pool: the transform endpoint's {@link withTransformLimit}
 * gate already provides cross-image parallelism, so each transform defaults to a single
 * libvips thread to bound memory on serverless (libaom still manages its own threads
 * for AVIF regardless of this). Override via the endpoint's `sharpConcurrency` option or
 * `IMAGES_SHARP_CONCURRENCY`; `0` resets Sharp to its default (CPU-core count). The
 * libvips operation cache is left at Sharp's default (50MB / 20 files / 100 ops), which
 * the docs recommend keeping enabled.
