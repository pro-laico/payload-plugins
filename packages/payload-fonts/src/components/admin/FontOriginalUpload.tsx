 * existing" control hidden (see the sibling stylesheet), so every slot always uploads a FRESH
 * original via "Create New".
 *
 * That enforces one `fontOriginal` per typeface slot — an original is never shared between
 * typefaces — which keeps asset cleanup trivially safe and race-free: a de-referenced or
 * deleted original can always be removed, with no reference count and no concurrent-delete
 * hazard (each typeface owns its own files).
