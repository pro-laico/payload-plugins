/**
 * Upserts one unresolved icon request into the `iconRequest` collection:
 * increments `count` + bumps `lastRequestedAt` for an existing name, or creates
 * the row. Self-gating — a no-op unless the collection is registered (via
 * `iconsPlugin({ trackRequests: true })`), so it's always safe to call.
 *
 * Deliberately free of `next/server` / `server-only` imports so it can be unit-
 * tested directly against a booted Payload; the request-scoped, throttled,
 * fire-and-forget wrapper lives in {@link file://./trackIconMiss.ts}.
 *
 * Best-effort by contract: callers should not await it on the render path, and
 * any concurrent-create race (two instances, same new name) simply loses one
 * increment.
